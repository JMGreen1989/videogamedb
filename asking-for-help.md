# Asking For Help

One of the things that we will exercise in projects is developing a work flow for asking for help that will translate to a professional development setting.

We will distinguish two kinds of support those that involve a computer and those that don't:

## Big Picture (no computer):

At any time you may request a meeting with your squad lead to discuss a big picture idea. The key constraint to these meetings is they may not involve computers or code. This is exclusively whiteboarding and conversation. (NOTE: squad leads are the point of contact for 6+ students. If a student frequently requests big picture meetings, a limit may be imposed)

## Technical Support:

If you are stuck on a technical issue, that makes a lot of sense because you are doing web development, it is tricky, and you are new to it.
Keep battling with it but make sure you are organized in your approach.
The problem will certainly be exacerbated if you add/change code trying to make things "look right"
Instead, carefully working through the code line by line, examine the error and develope concrete, testable theories about the root of the problem.

If you have been stuggling with a problem for an hour or more; you can request technical support by creating  an issue ticket on the project repo and filling out **ALL** of the following prompts:

    - I wanted ______ to happen.
    - I tried to make it happen by ______. (summary, link in code to follow)
    - I've pushed my current work to GitHub the code I am working on can be found \[here\]\(______\).
    - Instead of what I wanted to happen happening, ______ happened instead.
      - These are the related error logs: ______
      - There is no error but unintended behavior, ______
      (Some issues will have a combination of the above)
    - I have tried to trouble shoot my issue by referring to these resources:
      - Provide at least three links to lesson plans, official documentation, or stack overflow answers
      - If you were not able to find relevant resources, include the google searches you tried looking for resources
    - Assign **your squad leader** on the issue

### Why?

- In the process of actually writing this down, we often reveal misunderstandings and false assumptions that are hiding the issue. ([See Rubber Duck Debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging))
- It forces you to actually debug your code. Asking what an error means is not debugging; knowing what an error means is not debugging; learning what an error means is debugging.
- This is the approach we want to take any time we run into a problem -- in class and in the work place
  - In class it serves as an artifact of the solution to the problem and lets us practice technical fluency
  - In most work places this is the primary way you will be asking for support; the more clearly you can communicate in this medium the more people will be able to help you and the more happily they'll do it.
- It's good GitHub workflow practice

### Following _**ALL**_ of the correct steps will result in either of the following:

- A response in your issue - if possible the solition will be described in the issue ticket or via a PR (in the case of a PR, do not merge the PR as it will show up in the commit history; use the code as reference and close the PR).
- In the event the above is not possible; an in person meeting will be scheduled.

Happy Coding!
